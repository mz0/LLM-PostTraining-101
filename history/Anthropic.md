# Anthropic Timeline

### 2020 – 2021 Founding & Context
* Late 2020: Several senior OpenAI researchers and executives — including Dario Amodei (VP of Research at OpenAI),
  Daniela Amodei, and others — leave OpenAI due to internal disagreements over safety strategy and commercialization
  direction (notably Microsoft’s deep partnership).
* Early 2021: Anthropic founded by Dario and Daniela Amodei, with other ex-OpenAI staff.
  * Mission: “Build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.”
  * Focus: safety-aligned scaling and interpretability research.
* OpenAI connection: Founders and early engineers were core contributors to GPT-2, GPT-3, and the early RLHF work.
  Anthropic was essentially born as a “safety-first” offshoot.

### 2021 – 2022 Early Research & Claude Origins
* Conducted foundational work on Constitutional AI (alignment through rule-based self-supervision rather than pure RLHF)
* Released technical papers on model interpretability, reasoning transparency, and dataset filtering.
* Built internal models for experiments — precursors to Claude.

### 2023 Claude 1 → Claude 2 & Rapid Growth
* March 2023: Launch of Claude 1, Anthropic’s first public conversational model (API + integrations).
  * GPT-4 was already live; Anthropic positioned Claude as a more transparent, steerable alternative.
* July 2023: Claude 2 released with improved reasoning, longer context (~100 K tokens), and public web interface.
* Funding: Raised over $450 M (led by Spark Capital, Google Cloud, and others) — Google Cloud became its key partner
  (analogous to OpenAI↔ Microsoft/Azure).

### 2024 Claude 3 & Strategic Scaling
* March 2024: Release of Claude 3 family (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) — multimodal, competitive with GPT-4 and Gemini 1.
* June–Dec 2024: Multiple performance and latency upgrades; Claude integrated deeply with Amazon Bedrock.
* Funding: Amazon invests up to $4 B, becoming Anthropic’s primary infrastructure partner.

### 2025 Claude 3.5 and Next-Gen Alignment Research
* May 2025: Release of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (state-of-the-art reasoning, long-context up to ~200 K tokens).
* Continued work on interpretable reasoning traces, safety evaluations, and fine-grained control over model behavior.
* Preparing for Claude 4 series and deeper multimodality (vision, structured reasoning).
